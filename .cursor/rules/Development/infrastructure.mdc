-- React Context is used throughout the whole application to serve up relevant data that the application needs
-- Any references to API or FridgeAPI refer to an external computer that provides the context
-- Important: Context is system critical to use the application. If we don't have up-to-date context, the application will not work
-- AppContextType and ApiContextType within the root/index.d.ts refer to the structure of the context objects
