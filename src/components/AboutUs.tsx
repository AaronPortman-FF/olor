          <p>My name is Luis Zurias. I started Olor in Lincoln Park with $0 in the bank almost three years ago, working 14 hours or more each day and reinvesting everything. But just when everything seems to be going well, life hits you hard and reminds you that you are human and you can't handle everything yourself. It's quite difficult to understand, but you learn a lot in those bad moments.</p>

          <p>The second year was going great, but then after a few months of feeling unwell, the doctors told me that I need a liver transplant and they do not know exactly what destroyed my liver. Then I find out that I fought a large cancerous tumor that they didn't know I had, and it almost killed me if I didn't received the liver transplant that saved my life.</p>

          <p>Despite the challenges of continuing to run Olor while being very sick, the extremely difficult, physical and mental challenges, and the difficulty of not giving up, I have absolutely nothing to reproach life or God for, because in the same way, he has given me many good things, and sometimes the bad things that happen are necessary. I wanted to go too fast and achieve more, and I was forgetting to live. But the bad things clean up your life: of people, things, and to prioritize. It teaches you to perform better, and it is those moments that really make us who we are. And if it weren't for all that, I wouldn't see life the way I do now, where not only is achieving goals important. And although I had to stop projects to prioritize my health, I still love what I do, and if God allows me, I will resume projects and goals, but this time giving myself time to enjoy. There is still much to live, much to do, many dreams to achieve, and the day I have to leave, I want to be able to look back on my life and say that I did it all.</p>

          <p>I thank God first of all for giving me the opportunity to continue living, to the Northwestern transplant team for finding a liver that saved my life, to my family, to my work team at Olor, to all those people who knew and really stayed there, to this country because apart from owing it everything I have, all the opportunities it has given me, now I also owe it my life. May God always bless this country.</p>
